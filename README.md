To parse the HURDAT2 HTML database into a CSV file, use the file get-hurdat2-data.ipynb. It will create two files:\
-- hurdat2-A.csv (Atlantic Basin)      \
-- hurdat2-P.csv (North-East Pacific)  
Background information on the HURDAT2 database can be found on their webpage: https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html
